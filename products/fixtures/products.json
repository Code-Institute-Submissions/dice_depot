You build roads and new settlements that eventually become cities. Will you succeed in gaining supremacy on Catan? Barter trade dominates the scene. Some resources you have in abundance, other resources are scarce. Ore for wool, brick for lumber - you trade according to what is needed for your current building projects. Proceed strategically! If you found your settlements in the right places and skillfully trade your resources, then the odds will be in your favor. But your opponents are smart too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To begin the game, we build the game board using hexagonal terrain tiles. Catan is born - a beautiful island with mountains, pastures, hills, fields, and forests, surrounded by the sea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each of us places two small houses on spaces where three terrain hexes meet. They are our starting settlements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And so it begins. I roll two dice. An \u201c11\u201d! Each terrain hex is marked with a die roll number. Each player who owns a settlement adjacent to a terrain hex marked with the number rolled receives a resource produced by this hex. Hills produce brick, forests produce lumber, mountains produce ore, fields produce grain, and pastures produce wool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We use these resources to expand across Catan: we build roads and new settlements, or we upgrade our existing settlements to cities. For example, a road costs 1 brick and 1 lumber. If we do not have the necessary resources, we can acquire them by trading with our opponents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each settlement is worth 1 victory point and each city is worth 2 victory points. If you expand cleverly, you may be the first player to reach 10 victory points and thus win the game!</p>",
			"description_preview": " The women and men of your expedition build the first two settlements. Fortunately, the land is rich in natural resources. You build roads and new settlements that eventually become cities. Will you succeed in gaining supremacy on Catan? Barter trade dominates the scene. Some resources you have in abundance, other resources are scarce. Ore for wool, brick for lumber - you trade according to what is needed for your current building projects. Proceed strategically! If you found your settlements in the right places and skillfully trade your resources, then the odds will be in your favor. But your opponents are smart too. \r\n\r\n To begin the game, we build the game board using hexagonal terrain tiles. Catan is born - a beautiful island with mountains, pastures, hills, fields, and forests, surrounded by the sea. \r\n\r\n Each of us places two small houses on spaces where three terrain hexes meet. They are our starting settlements. \r\n\r\n And so it begins. I roll two dice. An \u201c11\u201d! Each terrain hex is marked with a die roll number. Each player who owns a settlement adjacent to a terrain hex marked with the number rolled receives a resource produced by this hex. Hills produce brick, forests produce lumber, mountains produce ore, fields produce grain, and pastures produce wool. \r\n\r\n We use these resources to expand across Catan: we build roads and new settlements, or we upgrade our existing settlements to cities. For example, a road costs 1 brick and 1 lumber. If we do not have the necessary resources, we can acquire them by trading with our opponents. \r\n\r\n Each settlement is worth 1 victory point and each city is worth 2 victory points. If you expand cleverly, you may be the first player to reach 10 victory points and thus win the game! ",

It's the Vikings' last chance to go down in a blaze of glory and secure their place in Valhalla at Odin's side! For a Viking there are many pathways to glory. You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards, crush your opponents in epic battles, fulfil quests, increase your clan's stats, or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnarok, the ultimate inescapable doom. Most player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These &quot;Gods' Gifts&quot; grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner. Players must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents' strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved, but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponents' actions and allegiances to specific gods, you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed. The only losing strategy in Blood Rage is to shy away from battle and a glorious death!",

Well, here we are a few years later with just that in hand. Our challenge to designer Matt Leacock was to create a game that would contain familiar elements (cooperative play, modular board), while offering up a completely different in-game experience. In addition, we wanted it to be simultaneously approachable to new players while upping the ante for those who felt they had mastered Forbidden Island. All this resulted in a fresh new game with an innovative set of mechanics, such as an ever-shifting board, individual resource management, and unique method for locating the flying machine parts.

Find out in <em>The Voyages of Marco Polo</em>!<br /><br /><strong>Preparing to Set Out</strong><br /><em>The Voyages of Marco Polo</em> is a Dice Placement game. At the beginning of each Round, players will roll their dice and then take turns placing those dice in space on the board for various effects. Some spaces have the same effect no matter the number on the die placed there, but some spaces have different effects depending on their result of the roll. Some spaces even require you commit multiple dice and take the action based on the lowest number rolled among the dice placed there.<br />Placing dice is how players move their merchants down the trade routes and toward Beijing, gather money to pay for goods and their travels, acquire resources to fulfill their contracts. And, spaces are limited! Once another player has filled a space, you'll need to spend more resources in order to take the same action, potentially setting your plan back or forcing you to readjust. Plan well and choose your actions wisely, and you may just find yourself ahead of the pack.<br /><br /><strong>Multiple Strategies</strong><br />There are many decisions to be made from round to round, and there are multiple avenues to victory in any given game. The roads you take to victory can change from game to game thanks to the special power of your character and the unique city bonuses used for each.<br /><br /><strong>Unique Powers<br /></strong> Each character has their own unique ability that can hugely impact your strategy as the game progresses. Raschid ad-Din allows you to choose the value of your dice rather than rolling them. Niccolo and Marco Polo give you an additional figure to move across the map and a camel at the beginning of every round. Take advantage of your special skills and leave your opponents in the dust!<br /><br /><strong>Different City Cards Every Game!<br /></strong> With 31 different city cards, every voyage will be unique. Plan your route carefully as you seek to take advantage of the bonuses each city has to offer. At the beginning of each game, the city bonus cards will be drawn randomly from the deck, providing new strategic opportunities and incredible replayability.</p>\r\n</div>",
