<h2>Design Choices</h2>

<h3>Fonts</h3>

<p>The primary font of The Dice Depot is Spectral SC, imported from Google Fonts. I wanted a font that was clearly stylised, but still looked professional
and remained easy to read. Spectral SC fit this criteria, as well as retaining a regal, fantasy-esque look, akin to the rulebooks of many fantasy based games.
As such, I felt that this was a perfect fit.</p>

<h3>Icons</h3>

<p>All icons are imported from FontAwesome. I decided to keep it simple in terms of icons so as to keep the page readable and easy to navigate. I opted to use a shopping
cart icon for the user's cart, and the profile icon for their profile page, and retained a clear, readable navbar.</p>

<h3>Background Image</h3>

<p>I wanted a background that would convey the purpose of the site, but that wasn't too busy or difficult to look at. I opted for a nice, clean blue background with a set of dice on
the right hand side, in order to keep the front page minimalist, but to still imply the purpose of the site to the user. The image was taken from Unsplash, which is a royalty free image library.</p>

<h3>Colour Scheme</h3>

<p>Similarly to the background image, I wanted the colour scheme to be fun, but not too busy.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Primary Colour : #6F732F; "Spanish Bistro" - A variant in the Phthalo Green palette that ebbs slightly towards yellow. Again, a bright colour but one that is easy on the eyes.</li>
    <li>Secondary Colour : #f5cb42;  - A royal Gold that contrasts well with the main site image and evokes a color scheme found in many available games</li>
    <li>White Colour : #ffffff; "White" - Shows up well against the Phthalo Green</li>
    <li>Black Colour : #000; "Black" - Standard CSS black</li>
    <li>Danger Colour : #ff0000; "Red" - Used to denote required elements and errors</li>
</ul>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<h2>Bugs</h2>

<h3>The Sell Form</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Issue : </strong>I ran into continual issues when trying to get the Sell form to post to the database.</li>
    <li><strong>Solution : </strong>Initially, I was trying to render the context before I had rendered any sort of form, which meant that the form simply didn't appear
    in the site. Rendering the context after checking the forms validity fixed this.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Navbar Link</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Issue : </strong>The actual link to the sell form worked on the index link,
    but not on the navbar link.</li>
    <li><strong>Solution : </strong>This was a simple one that took far too long to spot - I had rendered the section of the nav as a dropdown. Upon
    removing this value, the link worked perfectly.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Models - The JSON files</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Issue : </strong>I was initially unable to get the value of the age and players models to appear within the products model as foreign keys.</li>
    <li><strong>Solution : </strong>This took some time to wrap my head around, but soon made perfect sense. After creating the products model, I assumed if I made seperate json files with
    matching pk's, that all of these products would then 'sync up'. In essence,iIn my age and players models,I was trying to match the number of ages and players to the pk of the products in my products.json. 
    After several chats with Miklos, I understood that I needed to create a set number of fields, each with a unique value, then place those pk's in the products model - with the pk in this
    case referencing a value found in both the players and age json files. For example, if a product has an age of 1, this actually references the value 8, as has been set in the age.json file.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Secure Checkout</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Issue : </strong>Upon clicking 'secure checkout', my site did nothing, and just stayed on the same screen with all of the customer info still on screen.</li>
    <li><strong>Solution : </strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Delete</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Issue : </strong>The delete from bag function was initially unclickable, and didn't work.</li>
    <li><strong>Solution : </strong></li>
</ul>
