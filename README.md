<h2>Design Choices</h2>

<h3>Fonts</h3>

<p>The primary font of The Dice Depot is Spectral SC, imported from Google Fonts. I wanted a font that was clearly stylised, but still looked professional
and remained easy to read. Spectral SC fit this criteria, as well as retaining a regal, fantasy-esque look, akin to the rulebooks of many fantasy based games.
As such, I felt that this was a perfect fit.</p>

<h3>Icons</h3>

<p>All icons are imported from FontAwesome. I decided to keep it simple in terms of icons so as to keep the page readable and easy to navigate. I opted to use a shopping
cart icon for the user's cart, and the profile icon for their profile page, and retained a clear, readable navbar.</p>

<h3>Background Image</h3>

<p>I wanted a background that would convey the purpose of the site, but that wasn't too busy or difficult to look at. I opted for a nice, clean blue background with a set of dice on
the right hand side, in order to keep the front page minimalist, but to still imply the purpose of the site to the user. The image was taken from Unspash, which is a royalty free image library.</p>

<h3>Colour Scheme</h3>

<p>Similarly to the background image, I wanted the colour scheme to be fun, but not too busy.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Primary Colour : #264027; "Phthalo Green" - A forest green for the navbar that isn't too bright to look at and contrasts well with the main site image</li>
    <li>Secondary Colour : #6F732F; "Spanish Bistro" - A variant in the Phthalo Green palette that ebbs slightly towards yellow. Again, a bright colour but one that is easy on the eyes.</li>
    <li>Tertiary Colour : #B38A58; "Camel" - A calm yellow used for highliting agaisnt the green background whilst still blending somewhat.</li>
    <li>White Colour : #ffffff; "White" - Shows up well against the Phthalo Green</li>
    <li>Black Colour : #000; "Black" - Standard CSS black</li>
    <li>Danger Colour : #ff0000; "Red" - Used to denote required elements and errors</li>
</ul>
